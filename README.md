# QECToStim
Python-based quantum error-correction library that is extensible to many code families and integrates with simulation and decoding tools. This library interfaces with Stim (a fast stabilizer simulator) for circuit generation and automatically select appropriate decoders (e.g. PyMatching, Union-Find) based on the code’s syndrome structure.
